# Proof of concept for the SVG saving / loading

Demo: http://permacultr-svg.danielbeeke.nl/

- Use the search field to go to a location. Make sure to zoom in till you see contour lines.
- Use the square icon to start drawing a polygon.
- After creating a polygon the right side of the screen should show the contour lines and the base shape that you have drawn.
- You can now save the 'SVG'
- Reload the page and click on load, select the previously saved SVG.
- This flow can be better if you use Chrome, but the prototype does not focus on it. It can be better because Chrome keeps a reference to the file that is on the disk.
